# Project Status

This document is the only canonical source for Voydex's current implementation
checkpoint. Product contracts describe accepted behavior; code and tests remain
the evidence for exact implementation details.

## Current Foundation

- The architecture refactor is complete. Routes are thin, product code is owned
  by modules or global features, Supabase adapters live under `src/platform`,
  and `src/lib` is retired.
- The Voydex database source is authoritative in this repository under
  `database`, with deterministic generated local load artifacts and generated
  TypeScript types.
- The internal `reference` module owns reusable Pokémon and game contracts,
  domain rules, catalogue components, and presentation helpers.
- Application and database boundaries are enforced by automated checks.

## Implemented Product Surfaces

### Mainline

- `/mainline/plays` is an authenticated, real-data play browse.
- `/mainline/plays/[playId]` mounts the Play Hub.
- The Overview tab loads real play, team, progress, and recent-history data.
- Team, Progress, Plans, History, and Settings remain intentionally small tab
  shells until their workflows are implemented.
- The Team slice has a verified backend mutation path for adding a team member;
  no Team form is mounted yet.

### Codex

- Pokémon browse and game-scoped Pokémon detail are implemented with seeded
  reference data.
- Games browse, game detail, and game Pokedex routes are implemented.
- Species-only Pokémon detail routes redirect to a default supported game.

### Global Features

- Authentication, proxy session refresh, app shell, module-aware navigation,
  settings, site pages, and health surfaces have explicit owners.

## Next Product Slice

The next feature milestone should complete one Mainline golden loop rather than
expand architecture or future modules:

1. Create or open a play.
2. Add and manage a team member through the Team UI.
3. Record meaningful progress.
4. Confirm that Overview and history reflect the change.
5. Leave and resume the play successfully.

## Known Gaps

- There is no committed authenticated end-to-end browser suite.
- Authenticated Play Hub visual coverage still requires a stable test user or
  deterministic local browser fixture.
- Codex reference-query performance has not yet been profiled under realistic
  usage.
- Future product families remain backlog and should not receive schema or UI
  work before Mainline is useful end to end.

## Verification Checkpoint

The repository currently provides:

- Architecture enforcement over the active source tree.
- Focused Vitest coverage for domain, mapping, navigation, authentication, and
  database-audit helpers.
- Deterministic audits over 133 schema sources, 890 seed sources, and 638,246
  seed rows.
- Four pgTAP files with 52 assertions covering structural security, reference
  access, cross-user RLS, security-invoker views, and representative mutations.
- Local database reset, SQL formatting, lint, test, and generated-type parity.
